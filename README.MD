BIG ISSUES

- Missing IDS
  - Not sure why some are missing
  - Maybe says it doesnt have a theatrical release data
- Handling Budgets
  - Possibilities:
    - IMDB missing and TMDB missing
      - A LOT OF THESE
      - Maybe drop
      - Maybe interpolate
    - IMDB present and TMDB present
      - 2512 of these
      - Use IMDB
    - IMDB missing and TMDB present
      - 118 of these
      - Use TMDB and verify
      - Verify these
    - IMDB present and TMDB missing
      - 3797 of these
      - Use IMDB
- Checking which IDS are missing

- Name encoding issues

- TO DO:

- CHECK DATA BY YEAR TO SEE WHATS MISSING
- DATA QUALITY STUFF (comparisons and checking missing budgets)
- DIRECTOR AND PRODUCTION STAR SCORES

- FIXING PEOPLE STUFF
- CAST SIMILARITIES

- CHECK 118 MISSING IMDB REVENUES
  - also need to implement date (fed holiday or not)
